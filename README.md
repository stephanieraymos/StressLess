# StressLess
This is an app I created to help users reduce stress and anxiety. 

##Features
QUIZZES -This feature allows the user to get out of their heads and answer questions 
that inspire them to think deeply about their answer.
JOURNAL -This is a place for the user to get out their feelings so they can let go.
MUSIC -This section includes links to several YouTube videos behind image cards. These videos
known for their therapeutic and/or stress relieving characteristics.
YOGA -This section has different yoga poses that reduce tension. Each drop down
includes an image of the pose, a description of how to do the pose and a link to 
a video demonstrating the pose.
